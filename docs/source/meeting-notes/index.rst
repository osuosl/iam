Above is a collection of meeting notes held at the OSU Open Source Lab between
the OSL developers while working on Invoicing and Metrics.  It is mostly used
as a reference for the IaM devs to keep track of what was said when.  It may
also be a resource for community members to do some archaeological digging to
see how the project has evolved and developed over time for those who like
archeology.  More power to you.
