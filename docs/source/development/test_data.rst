Test Data
=========

Iam is equipped with a data exporting and importing classes that can extract
a complete set of anonymized client, project, resource and measurement data
from a staging or production instance. This data can then be imported into a
development instance in Docker or elsewhere to test features with a realistic
set of data.

DataImporter
------------

The DataImporter class contains methods for importing test data generated by
the DateExporter class.

Before importing data, be sure that data files exist in the test_data directory.
A set of test data should be included in this repository. If this data is
out of date, see DataExporter below for instructions on exporting new data.

**Usage**

IMPORTANT: This function destroys all data in the currently configured database
and should only ever be used in the environment of a Docker or other development
instance of the application. MAKE SURE YOUR INSTANCE IS NOT CONFIGURED TO USE
THE PRODUCTION OR STAGING DATABASES!

In the environment of a development instance of the application in docker or on
a workstation:

.. code-block:: bash

  rake import_data

If you are running an RVM ruby:

.. code-block:: bash

  rvm all do rake import_data

The rake task will remind you that this action will destroy all data in the
current database and require you to type 'YES' to continue. It will take some
time to load all the data.


DataExporter
------------

The DataExporter class takes a list of client ids and a timeframe in days, and
writes the data in json format to a series of files in the test_data
subdirectory. Each model or measurement table will be written to a separate
file named for the model or table.

It's a good idea to browse through the application you will be exporting from
and make sure that the clients you are exporting have appropriate data. Avoid
clients whose projects have very large numbers of resources, as this will export
a large amount of test data. A good selection would include clients with
different combinations of resources.

By default this will export all measuremnt data collected in the last 60 days.

**Usage**

In the environment of a staging or production instance of the app (an instance
that has collected significant real-world data):

This will extract all data associated with the specified clients, including all
measuremnts for all resources. The data will be anonymized by substituting any
names, email addresses, host name or ip addresses with random data while
maintaing the relationships between clients, projects, resources, and
measurements.

.. code-block:: bash

  rake export_data

or

.. code-block:: bash

  rvm all do rake export_data

If you would like to set a different time frame, set the EXPORT_DATA_DAYS
environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

  rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_DAYS=<int>

or

.. code-block:: bash

  rvm all do rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_DAYS=<int>


If you would like to set a different list of clients (see Rakefile for default).
set the EXPORT_DATA_CLIENTS environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

  rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_CLIENTS=<client_id>,<client_id>,<client_id>

or

.. code-block:: bash

  rvm all do rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_CLIENTS=<client_id>,<client_id>,...

If you would like to export data without anonymizing it, you can se the
EXPORT_DATA_ANON environment variable to 'false'

.. code-block:: bash

  rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_ANON='false'

or

.. code-block:: bash

  rvm all do rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_ANON='false'


You may set any or all variables at the same time:

.. code-block:: bash

  rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_DAYS=30 EXPORT_DATA_CLIENTS=1,2,6
  rake export_data EXPORT_DATA_DAYS=20 EXPORT_DATA_ANON='false'
